# Changes Summary: Adding Sorting & Delete URL Functionality

## Overview
We've implemented two key features for the LinkTrackRedirector application:

1. **Enhanced Sorting Functionality** - Users can now sort statistics by:
   - Total clicks (default)
   - Last click date
   - Short code
   - Target URL

2. **URL Deletion Capability** - Users can now delete URL mappings from the statistics page with a single click, removing all associated data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
Added a DELETE endpoint to `functions/index.js` for removing URL mappings:
- Route: `/api/delete-url/:shortCode`
- Deletes the URL mapping from:
  - In-memory cache
  - Firestore database
  - All related click data and summary documents
  - Realtime Database
- Returns appropriate success/error responses

### 2. Frontend UI Updates
Updated `functions/public/app.js` with:
- New `deleteUrlMapping()` function to handle deletion requests
- Updated `renderStatsTable()` function with:
  - Improved sorting logic for multiple fields
  - Delete button in the actions column
  - Better handling of sorting states
- Enhanced `initializeFilters()` function with more user-friendly filter options
- Added `showSuccess()` function to display success messages

### 3. CSS Styling
Created a new CSS file `functions/public/style.css` with:
- Styles for the delete button (red color)
- Sort indicators for table headers
- Improved filter section layout
- Better action button spacing
- Success/error message animations

### 4. HTML Updates
Updated `functions/public/index.html` to:
- Include the new CSS file
- Support the new UI components

### 5. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step instructions for implementing the features
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Deployment
The changes can be deployed with:
```bash
npx firebase deploy --only functions,hosting
```

## Testing
The implementation has been designed for easy testing:
1. Visit the Statistics tab
2. Try sorting by different columns
3. Test the delete functionality with test URLs
4. Verify that URL deletion removes all associated data
